# Leader is an earned title
***[Posted on Twitter 2021-02-17](https://twitter.com/asajohnson/status/1362241319691780098)***

There are leaders all around us and most people want to be one.

A pet-peeve of mine is the carefree usage of the term “Leadership Team” (LT) in corporations. It is often used to describe a group of people at certain organizational hierarchy levels. Perhaps it’s my Texas upbringing: we say “boss” or “manager” for the people in power positions and reserve “leader” to describe those who have earned it.

**A manager has the title, a leader has the people.**

In the last 15 years I’ve had 13 unique managers. They were all personable. Most of them were average or slightly above, with a few exceptions. **I learned from all of them, even if it was "what not to do".**

Two were out of their league - they twisted leadership and management strategies into weapons and turned our teams into toxic messes, leaving some individuals with real workplace trauma. 

Three were amazing - they couldn't always deliver what was needed, but they **fought like hell to do what was right, even when it wasn't easy.** They earned our trust by **actually listening** and **taking appropriate action.** They **got in (and out of) the trenches** when needed. They provided **real feedback** and **mentorship**. They **called us out on our bullshit** and **held us accountable** when we needed it. They **sponsored us** for opportunties - even when it didn't benefit them. They **protected** us. They **encouraged** us. They **balanced real-talk with optimism**.

To the people who were my manager AND a leader - thank you. I'm forever grateful. 👑
To the leaders who don't directly manage people, but who invest in others - thank you. You're making a difference. 👑
To the leaders who create other leaders - thank you. Your impact will be far and wide. 👑
To the leaders who may not be recognized by the people in power - thank you. Keep doing the right thing. 👑
To the people who are on “Leadership” or “eXtended Leadership” teams - earn it.
