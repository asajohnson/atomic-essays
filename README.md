# Atomic Essays ğŸš¢

Atomic essays are <250 word essays and the daily deliverable of [Ship 30 for 30](https://ship30for30.com/), a program to build an online writing habit in 30 days. They are typically posted in image format on Twitter, the size of a cell phone screenshot. This repository hosts the images and the text version of all my atomic essays.
