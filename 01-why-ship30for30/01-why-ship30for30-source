# Why I chose to join #Ship30for30 🚢

When I rejoined Twitter after 10 years, it surprised me to find out the people I work with may (seriously) be cooler than they originally appear. They do interesting personal projects I felt I didn’t have time for. I thought “If they can, why can’t I?”. 

I quickly learned **not only do I have time… but doing those projects you always wanted is addicting and even stress relieving!** It’s a snowball effect - once you get started, you’ll try to find even more time for them! **And this is the spice of life!**

My feed consists primarily of: K-12 educators, higher-ed academics, tech professionals, theologians, and “wannabe” philosophers and writers. **Most are normal people who are passionate about their area and want to talk about it civilly with other people.**

Somewhere from this eclectic mix, #Ship30for30 started appearing. I read many and loved them. Even in their brevity, they were deep. They spurred on intellectual discussion. I am normally turned off by fads, but **I am inspired by curious people with a passion to learn.**

A tipping point finally came – participating in these discussions was exciting, but was creating a whirlwind of new thoughts and ideas in my head. I had to get them out because it was getting overwhelming. **Unfortunately, passion and mild pain alone doesn’t usually carry you across the finish line. It can be the spark to get started, or fuel to go fast – but you need habits for the days it’s not there.**

So now **I will remind myself daily: Everyone must choose one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.** What do I have to lose but hours of doomscrolling? But I have the possibility to gain opportunities, value-added discussions, communities, reusable assets, something to show my kids later?

Thank you to the many ordinary, but inspiring people who have led me here!
